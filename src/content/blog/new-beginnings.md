For years, I’ve wanted to restart my blog but always hesitated. In the past,
blogging felt like a job that needed to be done with perfection. I treated every
post as a product meant to educate, attract and keep readers, to build something
that felt "worthy." Over time, that pressure turned what should have been a fun
activity into something exhausting. Eventually, I stopped altogether.

But here I am again, starting fresh. This time, it’s different.

I’ve learned that blogging doesn’t have to be about producing polished products
or chasing readership. It can be a space to think aloud, to explore ideas, and
to reflect. Rather than creating content for others, I’m framing this as a space
for me. A place for me to practice writing, to clarify my thoughts, and to
embrace the messy process of learning and growth.

Starting this blog anew also feels like a fitting reflection of where I am in
life. As a Ph.D. student, I’m constantly learning, unlearning, and
rediscovering. This blog—Perspectives in Progress—will mirror that journey. It’s
a place for my musings on research, technology, and life, as well as
HOWTOs for stuff I need to relearn a second time. It’s not about being
perfect or consistent—it’s about progress.

So, here’s the plan: no rigid schedules, no pressure. Just a commitment to show up and share what’s on my mind when I feel like it. They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This post is my first step. To anyone reading this, welcome. To myself, welcome back. Let’s see where this goes.
